- Eat yogurt and fermented foods such as sauerkraut, kimchi, and pickles, or drink kombucha. 
- chicken or beef bones. Simply put the bones in a pot, cover with water, and simmer for a loooong time (24 hours is good). 


Get outside and get sunlight. There’s a reason depression is associated with darkness.
Ask for help. Start to find your tribe of helpers. That may include a doctor, a therapist, close supportive friends and family members, a fitness trainer, even a pet.
Move. Depression is immobilizing. Do your best to act against that force by moving whatever you can move, however you can move it.
Express yourself. Draw, write, talk about what you’re feeling, howl at the moon. Or, like me, smash a punching bag. Whatever gets the bad stuff out. Don’t keep it all in there.
